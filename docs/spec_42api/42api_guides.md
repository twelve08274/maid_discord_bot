## API仕様概要 (Specification)

The 42 API provide programmatic access to read and write 42's data. You can get and interact with the whole intranet data, and do things such creating a new message on the forum, read users profiles, get datas on a project, and more.
On his second version, it identifies 42 applications and users using OAuth, and responses are available in JSON.

Whether you're looking to build an official 42 integration for your service, or you just want to build something awesome, [we can help you get started](/apidoc/guides/getting_started).

The API works over the https protocol. and accessed from the *api.intra.42.fr* domain.

- The current endpoint is [https://api.intra.42.fr/v2](https://api.intra.42.fr/v2).
- All data is sent and received as JSON.
- Blank fields are included as null instead of being omitted.
- All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format

---

## Current version

The current API version is *2.0*.

## Authentication

The authentication on the 42 API works with [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/).

OAuth2 is a protocol that lets external apps request authorization to private details in a user’s 42 account without getting their password. This is preferred over a basic authentication because tokens can be limited to specific types of data, and can be revoked by users at any time.

All developers need to [register their application](https://profile.intra.42.fr/oauth/applications/new) before getting started. A registered OAuth application is assigned a unique Client ID and Client Secret. The Client Secret should not be shared.

Once the access token aquired, it can be passed in the URL with the `access_token` parameter, or in the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN` header field.

## Errors

The 42 API uses the following error codes:

Http Code
Error code
Meaning

400

The request is malformed

401

Unauthorized

403

Forbidden

404

Page or resource is not found

422

Unprocessable entity

500

We have a problem with our server. Please try again later.

Connection refused

Most likely cause is not using HTTPS.

## Scopes

App can have different access scopes.

Authorization scopes are a way to determine to what extent the client can use resources located in the provider.

When the client requests the authorization it specifies in which scope they would like to be authorized. This information is then displayed to the user - resource owner - and they can decide whether or not they accept the given application to be able to act in specified scopes.

Requesting a resource with wrong or insufficient scopes will return a `403 Forbidden` response, with more details in the `WWW-Authenticate` response header. For example, for an application without the `projects` scope:

```
POST https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/topics/4242/messages

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Pragma: no-cache
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Vary: Origin
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="42 API", error="insufficient scope", error_description="The action need the following scopes: [forum]"

X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

{
    "error": "Forbidden",
    "message": "Insufficient scope. The action need the following scopes: [forum] (Create, update and destroy topics and messages)"
}

```

## Pagination

The 42 API paginates all resources on the index method.

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 30 items by default. You have two ways to specify further pages:

- The `page` parameter. You can also set a custom page size (up to 100) with the `per_page` parameter. 
- The `page[number]` paramater with the `page[size]` parameter.

Note that for technical reasons not all endpoints can go up to 100 on the the `per_page` / `page[size]` parameter.

The `Link` HTTP response header contains pagination data with `first`, `previous`, `next` and `last` raw pages links when available, under the format

```
link: ; rel="next", ; rel="prev", ; rel="first", ; rel="last"

```

There is also:

- A `X-Page` header field, which contains the current page.
- A `X-Per-Page` header field, which contains the current pagination length.
- A `X-Total` header field, which contains the count of pages.

## Filtering

The `filter` query parameter can be used to filter a collection on one or several fields for one or several values. The `filter` parameter takes the field to filter as a key, and the values to filter as the value. Multiples values must be comma-separated (`,`).

For example, the following is a request for all users who have their piscine in 2013, but only in September or July:

```
GET /users?filter[pool_year]=2013&filter[pool_month]=september,july HTTP/1.1

```

## Sorting

All index endpoints support multiple sort fields by allowing comma-separated (`,`) sort fields, they are applied in the order specified.

The sort order for each sort field is ascending unless it is prefixed with a minus (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, “-“), in which case it is descending.

For example, `GET /users?sort=kind,-login` will return the users sorted by kind. Any users with the same kind will then be sorted by their login in descending alphabetical order.

## Rate limiting

By default, your applications has limited to `2 requests/second` and `1200 requests / hour`

## JSON-API format (Decommissioned)

  The API actually support (in an alpha-stage) the [JSON-API](http://jsonapi.org/) format specification.
    You can request a JSON-API by specifying the request `ContentType` as `application/vnd.api+json`.

## Getting informations about your token

If you want to know more about your token, you can fetch **[https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token/info](https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token/info)**.

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token/info

# {"resource_owner_id":74,"scopes":["public"],"expires_in_seconds":7174,"application":{"uid":"3089cd94d72cc9109800a5eea5218ed4c3e891ec1784874944225878b95867f9"},"created_at":1439460680}%

```

## はじめ方 (Getting Started)

## Create an application

In order to use the 42 API, you first need to create a v2 application [here](https://profile.intra.42.fr/oauth/applications/new).

You will need to configure a few things in order to make your application:

- **The name** of your application, wich needs to be explicit (please avoid names like test or app).
- **The redirect URI(s)**. Theses URI(s) are needed if you app acts as a third tier between the 42 data and an user (this *flow* is called `Web Application Flow`), and specify where the user need to be redirected after his authentication. If you plan to use your app just as a server-side app, without user interaction, you can set any valid adress, you'll not need theses URI.
- **The scopes** you'll need. A scope is an aera of access. By default, your application only have access to public data, it's your call to add more scopes. Try to *only add the scopes you'll really need*, you can change your application scopes later if you need more permissions. 
- **Public** set if your application is visible by other users or not.
- **All the other fields** are facultative, and can be set later.

Note: The complete description of the authentication process through the OAuth2 Web Application Flow is described in [the next section of this guide](/apidoc/guides/web_application_flow).

## Get your credentials

Awesome ! You just created your first application !
Now, take a look on your application page, we got a lot of informations there, but the most important are:

- *The client uid*, an unique identifier for your application.
- *The client secret*, an secret passphrase for your application, which **must be kept secret**, and only used on server side, where users can't see it.

## Make basic requests

Now, you have all you need to setup a little basic script using the API trough your application. In this example, we will use the **Client Credentials Flow**, in ruby, with the [OAuth2 ruby wrapper](https://github.com/intridea/oauth2), but OAuth2 wrappers exists in most languages.
The Client Credentials flow is probably the most simple flow of OAuth 2 flows. The main difference from the others is that this flow is not associated with a user.
You can read more about this OAuth flow [directly from the reference documentation of OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4).

First of all, we'll request an access token with our application credentials.

```

require "oauth2"

UID = "Your application uid"
SECRET = "Your secret token"

# Create the client with your credentials
client = OAuth2::Client.new(UID, SECRET, site: "https://api.intra.42.fr")

# Get an access token
token = client.client_credentials.get_token

```

Requesting an access token with the client credentials flow is, in fact, just a POST request on the `/oauth/token` endpoint with a `grant_type` parameter set to `client_credentials`. If you wanted to do this with the command line, the equivalent Curl line will be:

```
curl -X POST --data "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=MY_AWESOME_UID&client_secret=MY_AWESOME_SECRET" https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token
```

```
{
  "access_token":"42804d1f2480c240f94d8f24b45b318e4bf42e742f0c06a42c6f4242787af42d",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "expires_in":7200,
  "scope":"public",
  "created_at":1443451918
}

```

Now, we can fetch all the public data which don't need user authentication, like the list of the cursus in 42.
The [reference documentation](https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc) gave us ([by the `Cursus` resource page](https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc/2.0/cursus.html)) the endpoint `/v2/cursus`.

```

token.get("/v2/cursus").parsed
# => [{"id"=>1, "created_at"=>"2014-11-02T17:43:38.480+01:00", "name"=>"42", "slug"=>"42", "users_count"=>1918, "users_url"=>"https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/cursus/42/users", "projects_url"=>"https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/cursus/42/projects", "topics_url"=>"https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/cursus/42/topics"}, ...]

```

Hooray ! We got our data ! And what about the users in the cursus `42` ?

```

users_in_cursus = token.get("/v2/cursus/42/users").parsed
# => {"id"=>2, "login"=>"avisenti", "url"=>"https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/users/avisenti", "end_at"=>nil}, {"id"=>3, "login"=>"spariaud", "url"=>"https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/users/spariaud", "end_at"=>nil}, ...
users_in_cursus.count
# => 30

```

What the hell ? Only 30 users ? And what says the [documentation](https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc/2.0/cursus_users/index.html) about that ?

## Pagination

The documentation says that the resource is paginated by 30 items by defaut, and that we can specify a `page[number]` parameter (or, more simpler, the `page` parameter), in order to navigate trough it.
Let's try to fetch the second page:

```
second_page = token.get("/v2/cursus/42/users", params: {page: {number: 2}})
# => # {"id"=>35, "login"=>"droger", "url"=>"https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/users/droger", "end_at"=>nil}, {"id"=>36, "login"=>"edelbe", "url"=>"https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/users/edelbe", "end_at"=>nil}, ...

```

Well, it seems to work ! But how can we know if there is a next page ? One simple solution is to go forward until the call returns an empty array, but if we need more informations, we can take a look on the `Link` HTTP response header.

```
second_page.headers["Link"]
# => "; rel=\"next\", ; rel=\"prev\", ; rel=\"first\", ; rel=\"last\""

```

We now have the links for the first, the next, the previous and the last pages.
The response headers contains a lot of more or less useful informations, like the name of your application, the id and the roles.

```
GET https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/messages?page[number]=1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
ETag: W/"b326132feb08f61b7de85a13ca83f264"
Link: ; rel="first", ; rel="prev", ; rel="last", ; rel="next"
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Vary: Origin
X-Application-Id: 318
X-Application-Name: test-app
X-Application-Roles: None
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Meta-Request-Version: 0.4.0
X-Page: 2
X-Per-Page: 30
X-Rack-CORS: preflight-hit; no-origin
X-Request-Id: c763e95e-95a6-4307-88da-f441038be349
X-Runtime: 0.278242
X-Total: 17570
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

{...}

```

You can also increase the number of results returned by the request with the `page[size]` parameter (or the `per_page` parameter). Almost all the endpoints can return up to 100 results per page.

## Limits

By default, your applications has limited to `2 requests/second` and `1200 requests / hour`

## Roles

Applications can have **roles**, which grants particular privileges.

There is a short list of the most common roles:

- Alpha: Unstable features
- Beta: Intranet beta-testers
- Official App: Approved application to up rate limit
- Certified App: Certified application manually by a staff member to up rate limit and access to more features
- Moderator: Moderate topics, messages and versions on the forum
- Basic Tutor: Manage projects, scales and all cursus related data
- Basic Staff: Member of the staff, can manage community services, closes, exams and
access advanced student data

The roles of your application are present in the `x-application-roles` field of the response header.

If your application is production ready, public and useful, you can [send us a mail](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec8582989e8d98898d81acd8dec28a9e) to request the `Official App` role.

That's it for now. If your want to go deeper, and allow users to use their 42 account from a third-party website, you can continue with the [web application flow tutorial](/apidoc/guides/web_application_flow).

## Getting informations about your token

If you want to know more about your token, you can fetch **[https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token/info](https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token/info)**.

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token/info

# {"resource_owner_id":74,"scopes":["public"],"expires_in_seconds":7174,"application":{"uid":"3089cd94d72cc9109800a5eea5218ed4c3e891ec1784874944225878b95867f9"},"created_at":1439460680}%

```

## Webアプリケーションフロー (Web Application Flow)

This is a description of the OAuth2 flow from 3rd party web sites.

In the Web Application flow (also known as the Authorization Code flow), the resource owner (a 42 user) is first redirected by the application to the OAuth authorization server at the API provider. The authorization server checks to see if the user has an active session (in our case, if the user is logged on the 42 intranet). If she does, the authorization server prompts her for access to the requested data.
After she grants access, she is redirected back to the web application and an authorization code is included in the URL as the code query parameter: `http://www.example.com/oauth_callback?code=ABC1234`

Because the code is passed as a query parameter, the web browser sends it along to the web server that is acting as the OAuth client. This authorization code is then exchanged for an access token using a server-to-server call from the application to the authorization server. This access token is used by the client to make API calls.

Let's see how we can implement it with the 42 API.

## Redirect users to request 42 access

That's the first step. Link or redirect users to the API authorize url: `https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/authorize`.
This must be properly formatted for your application and will return a permissions screen for the user to authorize. For convenience, a formatted authorize URL including your client_id is provided for each application in the [apps page](https://profile.intra.42.fr/oauth/applications).

##### Base url

```
GET https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/authorize

```

##### Parameters

Name
Type
Description

client_id
string
**Required**. The client ID you received from 42 when you [registered](https://profile.intra.42.fr/oauth/applications/new).

redirect_uri
string
**Required**. The URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization. See details below about [redirect urls](#redirect-urls).

scope
string
A space separated list of [scopes](#scopes). If not provided, `scope` defaults to an empty list of scopes for users that don't have a valid token for the app. For users who do already have a valid token for the app, the user won't be shown the OAuth authorization page with the list of scopes. Instead, this step of the flow will automatically complete with the same scopes that were used last time the user completed the flow.

state
string
An unguessable random string. It is used to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.

response_type
string
The response type. Ususally `code`.

All this things will make together a nice and understandable URI, like:

```
https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/authorize?client_id=your_very_long_client_id&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A1919%2Fusers%2Fauth%2Fft%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=public&state=a_very_long_random_string_witchmust_be_unguessable'

```

*Small note*: when formatting the scopes parameters, be sure to read above about the distinction between application-level and token-level scopes. this has been a point of friction for some developers.

## 42 redirects back to your site

 *The 42 auth dialog*

If the user grants the permission for your application to use the requested data (see [scopes](#scopes)), it will be redirected to your `redirect_uri` with a temporary code in a GET `code` parameter as well as the state you provided in the previous step in a `state` parameter.

If the states don't match, the request has been created by a third party and the process should be aborted.

## Exchange your code for an access token

You're almost here !
The last thing to do is a POST request to the `https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token` endpoint, with your `client_id`, your `client_secret`, the previous `code` and your `redirect_uri`. **This request must be performed on server side, over a secure connexion**.

Useless note: This corresponds to the token endpoint, section 3.2 of the OAuth 2 RFC. Happy ?

##### Base url

```
POST https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token

```

##### Parameters

Name
Type
Description

grant_type
string
**Required**. The grant type. In this case, it's `authorization_code`.

client_id
string
**Required**. The client ID you received from 42 when you registered.

client_secret
string
**Required**. The client secret you received from 42 when you registered.

code
string
**Required**. The code you received as a response to [Step 1](#1-redirect-users-to-request-42-access).

redirect_uri
string
The URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization.

state
string
The unguessable random string you optionally provided in [Step 1](#1-redirect-users-to-request-42-access).

For example, with curl:

```
curl -F grant_type=authorization_code \
-F client_id=9b36d8c0db59eff5038aea7a417d73e69aea75b41aac771816d2ef1b3109cc2f \
-F client_secret=d6ea27703957b69939b8104ed4524595e210cd2e79af587744a7eb6e58f5b3d2 \
-F code=fd0847dbb559752d932dd3c1ac34ff98d27b11fe2fea5a864f44740cd7919ad0 \
-F redirect_uri=https://myawesomeweb.site/callback \
-X POST https://api.intra.42.fr/oauth/token

```

## Make API requests with your token

Include your token in all your requests in a authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

```

For example, you can fetch the current token owner, with curl:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://api.intra.42.fr/v2/me

# {"id":56911,"email":"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)","login":"30_1","url":"http://localhost:13000/v2/users/pedago","phone":"hidden","displayname":"Philibert Edago","image_url":"https://cdn.intra.42.fr/userprofil/pedago.jpg","staff?":false,"correction_point":3,"pool_month":null,"pool_year":null,"location":null,"wallet":5,"groups":[],"cursus":[{"cursus":{"id":1,"name":"42","created_at":"2014-11-02T16:43:38.480Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T14:33:59.420Z","slug":"42","kind":"normal"},"end_at":null,"level":0.0,"grade":"cadet","projects":[],"skills":[]},{"cursus":{"id":4,"name":"Piscine C","created_at":"2015-05-01T17:46:08.433Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T17:09:43.612Z","slug":"piscine-c","kind":"normal"},"end_at":null,"level":0.0,"grade":null,"projects":[],"skills":[]}],"achievements":[...],"titles":[],"partnerships":[],"patroned":[],"patroning":[],"expertises_users":[],"campus":[{"id":1,"name":"Paris","time_zone":"Paris","language":{"id":1,"name":"Français","identifier":"fr","created_at":"2014-11-02T16:43:38.466Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T13:40:28.805Z"},"users_count":5929,"vogsphere_id":1}]}

```

If you can't modify http headers, you can send your token as a `access_token` parameter.
